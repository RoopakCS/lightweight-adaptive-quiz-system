# LAQS Project Summary

## Project Overview

**Lightweight Adaptive Quiz System (LAQS)** is a complete, research-grade implementation of an adaptive learning assessment system that dynamically adjusts question difficulty based on learner performance.

## What Was Built

### Core Components (7 Python Modules)

1. **question_bank.py** - Synthetic question database with 100 questions across 5 topics and 3 difficulty levels
2. **adaptive_engine.py** - Rule-based algorithm that adjusts difficulty using accuracy and time thresholds
3. **learner_simulation.py** - Diverse learner profiles with varying abilities, learning rates, and response patterns
4. **quiz_simulation.py** - Experiment runner comparing adaptive vs non-adaptive quiz approaches
5. **performance_tracker.py** - Comprehensive metrics tracking (accuracy, mastery, time, progression)
6. **visualization.py** - 5 different plot types for analyzing results
7. **analysis.py** - Statistical tests (t-tests, Cohen's d, learning gains)

### Execution Scripts

- **main.py** - Command-line interface with quick demo and full simulation modes
- **example_notebook.ipynb** - Interactive Jupyter notebook for exploration

### Documentation

- **README.md** - Complete project documentation (2000+ words)
- **QUICKSTART.md** - Quick start guide with usage examples
- **LICENSE** - MIT License
- **.gitignore** - Proper Python project ignore rules

## Key Features

### Adaptive Algorithm

```python
if accuracy > 80% and avg_time < threshold:
    â†’ Increase difficulty (harder question)
elif accuracy < 50%:
    â†’ Decrease difficulty (easier question)
else:
    â†’ Maintain current difficulty
```

### Learner Diversity

- **Struggling learners** (33%): 30-50% base ability
- **Average learners** (33%): 50-75% base ability  
- **Advanced learners** (33%): 75-90% base ability
- Each with unique learning rates, speeds, and consistency

### Comprehensive Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct answers
- **Mastery Index**: Weighted (difficulty Ã— accuracy)
- **Response Time**: Average time per question
- **Difficulty Progression**: Track of adaptations
- **Learning Gains**: Pre-test to post-test improvement

### Statistical Rigor

- Independent t-tests for significance
- Cohen's d for effect sizes
- Descriptive statistics (mean, std, median, range)
- Learning gain analysis
- 150+ sessions analyzed (default configuration)

## Output Files

### Data Files (`data/`)
- `question_bank.csv` - All questions with metadata
- `session_results.csv` - Session-level summaries

```

### Custom Configuration
```bash
python main.py --learners 20 --sessions 7 --questions 25
```

### Programmatic Use
```python
from src import QuestionBank, LearnerPopulation, ExperimentRunner

qb = QuestionBank(num_questions=100)
population = LearnerPopulation(num_learners=15)
runner = ExperimentRunner(qb)
results = runner.run_population_experiment(population, num_sessions=5)
```

## Expected Results

Based on the design, the adaptive system should demonstrate:

1. **5-15% higher accuracy** than static quizzes
2. **10-20% better mastery** index scores
3. **3-5 difficulty adjustments** per session on average
4. **Statistically significant** improvements (p < 0.05)
5. **Medium to large effect sizes** (Cohen's d > 0.5)
